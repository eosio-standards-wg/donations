Donations
---------

The organization is not formed yet, and there is no clear
understanding on how donations would be spent, should there be
any. There is definitely no intent to grab the money silently. Most
probably this fund will be managed by a multi-signature as soon as the
organization grows.

Donations are welcome at `stdworkgroup` account on EOS, Telos, BOS,
WAX, INSTAR, and `stdworkgrp.m` on MEET.ONE.

Currently these accouts are controlled by community member `cc32d9`,
until we find a better form of organization.
